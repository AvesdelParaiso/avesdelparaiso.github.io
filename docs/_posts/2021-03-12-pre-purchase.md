Yes! Today the lawyer called us and had some good news to tell us! We have a ‘go’ again. I already printed out the new contract early in the morning because I planned to go to the beach with a friend. So Thomas sent the signed copies and we received a signed copy back. Now we need to pay the money for the reservation, this will later be deducted from the total price. We’re so happy that it’s official now! Because other people send in an offer too, but luckily we were the first. The whole process of signing the official contract and receiving the keys will take up to 3 months. So hopefully we can start renovating when it’s summer. Until then we have enough time to learn more about permaculture, renovating and food/rain harvesting. At the same time we can practise our Spanish, because we really want to integrate in the community. This will be it for a while, hopefully nothing bad will come up and we can focus on making our dream come true!
