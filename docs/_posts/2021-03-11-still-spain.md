So we just woke up and got a call from our lawyer. But not with the news that we wanted, because the house is apparently not registered. In Spain a house needs to be registered at the municipality and the national registry. When this is not done correctly the house is illegal and there is a change that you, as the new owner, needs to take it down. If this is not the case you need all the right paperwork as we wouldn’t even be allowed to work on the house. And we already experienced how long these things can take here (it took us 6 months and the help of a gestor to register our car). 
We don’t want to go through all this trouble again so we immediately called the realtor. The realtor just found out himself, but he already spoke to the notary and didn’t foresee any problems. This house isn’t connected to the main electricity network or water, so there is no need for a state architect to check the house. But just to be sure we let this include in the contract just in case it doesn’t work out the way we want. And also we don’t have to pay any extra costs now that comes with the registry. Hopefully we can sign the new contract soon!
